# Inventory Management
An inventory management website where you can add games to a database and manage them via the website.

This is my first independent full-stack project using Express for the backend and MongoDB for the database. I learnt alot about how the backend works and it's given more clarity to full-stack applications.

## Features
- Add a game to the database 
- Update any game's information (Title, Release Date, Copies, Image URL) 
- Delete a game from the database 

I deployed the frontend and the backend using [Render](https://render.com/).
